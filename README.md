# Sudoku Solver

solver.py - Takes a 9x9 array of a sudoku puzzle and returns the solved version.
sudoku.py - Visits a sudoku website and scrapes the puzzle, passes it to solver, and then types it in.

Next, I'll be using machine learning to recognize a sudoku puzzle out of a photo. Then, I will overlay the solution the photo.

After that, hopefully I can implement a live version that will overlay it on a camera feed, similar to Google Translate.

If I get that far I'll package it into an iOS app.
